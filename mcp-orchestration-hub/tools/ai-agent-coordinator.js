This includes the MCP Conductor (main orchestration engine), Server Registry (tracking all available servers), and Capability Indexing (intelligent capability discovery and matching).`,
    
    2: `Create the AI brain of the orchestration system. You will implement LLM-powered intelligent routing, intent analysis, and capability matching. Your work enables the system to understand user requests and automatically route them to the optimal MCP servers.`,
    
    3: `Build the community ecosystem that enables server discovery, sharing, and collaboration. You will integrate with GitHub for server discovery, create the marketplace for server sharing, and implement trust/rating systems for community-driven quality.`,
    
    4: `Create the user-facing web interface that provides real-time visibility into the orchestration system. Build interactive dashboards, server status monitoring, and tools for users to manage their MCP ecosystem.`,
    
    5: `Implement the tool caching and quick-launch system that makes MCP interactions lightning-fast. Build intelligent caching, metadata management, and reusable tool storage to eliminate repetitive tool generation.`,
    
    6: `Enhance Git operations and automate deployment workflows. Create seamless integration between local development and GitHub, enabling automated publishing, release management, and community distribution.`,
    
    7: `Ensure quality, reliability, and performance across all components. Build comprehensive testing infrastructure, validate integrations, and maintain performance benchmarks for the entire system.`
