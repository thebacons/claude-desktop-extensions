- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for unlimited capabilities

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Three-Layer Design**
1. **Orchestration Layer**: Traffic control and capability routing
2. **Intelligence Layer**: AI-powered discovery and composition
3. **Community Layer**: GitHub-integrated sharing and marketplace

### **AI-Native Development**
This project is built using **distributed AI development** with multiple Claude Opus 4 agents working on parallel feature branches:

- **Agent 1**: Core Engine (MCP Conductor, Server Registry)
- **Agent 2**: AI Intelligence (LLM routing, capability matching)
- **Agent 3**: Community Hub (GitHub integration, marketplace)
- **Agent 4**: Web Interface (Real-time dashboard, management)
- **Agent 5**: Tool Cache (Interactive tool management)
- **Agent 6**: GitHub Enhanced (Advanced Git operations)
- **Agent 7**: Testing & QA (Comprehensive validation)

## 🚀 Quick Start
