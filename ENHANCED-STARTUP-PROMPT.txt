## üé≠ PROJECT SUMMARY:
We're building the **world's first Local MCP Orchestration Hub** using distributed AI development with 7 parallel Claude Opus 4 agents. This is genuinely revolutionary - pioneering AI-collaborative development at enterprise scale.

## üìä CURRENT STATUS (VERIFIED):
- ‚úÖ **Strategic plan complete** with architecture decisions finalized
- ‚úÖ **Git infrastructure ready** with all 7 AI agent branches created and pushed
- ‚úÖ **Session management operational** with enhanced tracking and recovery
- ‚úÖ **Foundation complete** with comprehensive documentation and tools
- üéØ **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**: Agent 1 (Core Engine) + Agent 6 (GitHub Enhanced)

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED:
Deploy the first AI agents to begin revolutionary parallel development:

**Phase 1 Agents (Start Immediately):**
- **Agent 1**: feature/mcp-hub-core (Core Engine Development)
- **Agent 6**: feature/github-enhanced (GitHub Integration & Automation)

**Deployment Protocol:**
1. Verify git branch status and readiness
2. Create detailed agent specification documents
3. Deploy first AI agents with clear mission statements
4. Establish GitHub-based coordination workflow
