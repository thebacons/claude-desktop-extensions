## 🚀 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (First 5 Minutes of Next Session)

### **🔴 CRITICAL FIRST STEP: SESSION STATUS CHECK**
```
ALWAYS START WITH: Check session status to understand current limits
- Message count
- Token usage  
- Time elapsed
- Warning levels
Use SESSION-COMMANDS.md for proper status monitoring
```

### **Step 1: Deploy Foundation AI Agents**
**Agent 1 Assignment:**
```
Branch: feature/mcp-hub-core
Mission: Core MCP Conductor + Server Registry + Capability Indexing
Timeline: Week 1
Dependencies: None
```

**Agent 6 Assignment:**
```
Branch: feature/github-enhanced  
Mission: Git operations + deployment automation + release management
Timeline: Week 1 (parallel with Agent 1)
Dependencies: None
```

### **Step 2: Establish Coordination Workflow**
- GitHub-based daily status updates
- Integration checkpoints every 2 days
- Agent status reporting via pull requests
- Rollback procedures for failed integrations
