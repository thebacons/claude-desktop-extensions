## 💬 EXACT CONTINUATION PROMPT

**Copy this message to the new Claude session:**

```
I need you to recover our previous session and continue exactly where we left off.

Please:

1. Read the session handoff log: C:\Users\colin\Documents-local\20_Claude-Desktop-PoC\claude-desktop-extensions-local\SESSION-LOG-2025-06-29-002-TEST.json

2. Review the project status: C:\Users\colin\Documents-local\20_Claude-Desktop-PoC\claude-desktop-extensions-local\mcp-orchestration-hub\CURRENT-STATUS.md

3. Load the session recovery guide: C:\Users\colin\Documents-local\20_Claude-Desktop-PoC\claude-desktop-extensions-local\SESSION-RECOVERY-IMPLEMENTATION.md

We were building a revolutionary MCP Orchestration Hub with distributed AI development using 7 parallel Claude Opus 4 agents. We had just completed building the session recovery system and were about to initialize the git repository and create feature branches for AI agent deployment.

Our immediate next step is to execute the git initialization commands in the mcp-orchestration-hub directory.

Please confirm you've loaded the complete context and tell me you're ready to proceed with the git initialization.
