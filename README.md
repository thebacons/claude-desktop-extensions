# Claude Desktop Extensions

A curated collection of Claude Desktop Extensions (.dxt files) that enhance Claude's capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## What are Claude Desktop Extensions?

Claude Desktop Extensions (.dxt files) are self-contained packages that enable Claude Desktop to interact with local applications, access private data, and integrate with development tools‚Äîall while keeping data on your machine.

## Development

### Building Extensions

Each extension can be built into a `.dxt` file using the standard DXT toolchain:

```bash
# Navigate to extension directory
cd extensions/windows-command-mcp-server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build .dxt file (requires DXT CLI)
dxt build
```

### Contributing

We welcome contributions! To add a new extension:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new directory in `extensions/`
3. Follow the [DXT specification](https://github.com/anthropics/dxt)
4. Include comprehensive documentation
5. Test thoroughly
6. Submit a pull request

### Extension Guidelines

- **Documentation**: Include detailed README with use cases and installation instructions
- **Security**: Implement proper input validation and security measures
- **Error Handling**: Provide comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Testing**: Include test cases and validation
- **Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with latest Claude Desktop versions

## Security Considerations

### What Extensions Can Do
- Execute commands you explicitly request through Claude
- Access files and folders based on your user permissions
- Launch applications and system utilities
- Perform calculations and data processing

### What Extensions Cannot Do
- Execute commands without your explicit request to Claude
- Access files outside your user permission scope
- Run automatically in the background
- Connect to external networks independently

### Best Practices
1. **Review commands** before confirming execution
2. **Avoid running commands** you don't understand
3. **Use with trusted content** only
4. **Keep Claude Desktop updated** for security patches
